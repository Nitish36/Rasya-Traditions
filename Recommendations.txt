1. Online Booking & Scheduling
Currently, she handles everything via WhatsApp. As she gets more customers, she might want to automate.
The Idea: Integrate a calendar (like Calendly or a custom JS calendar) where people can select a specific "Drop-off Slot" or "Pick-up Slot."
Benefit: This prevents 10 people from showing up at her house at the same time and helps her manage her daily workload.

2. E-Commerce (The "Rasya Care" Shop)
She can move from selling a service to selling products.
The Idea: Add a small shop section to sell:
Signature Saree Bags: High-quality cotton/muslin bags with her branding.
Premium Safety Pins: Clips that don't snag delicate silk.
Pre-Pleating Accessories: Saree silhouettes or shapers.
Benefit: Additional revenue without extra labor.

3. Subscription Models (Recurring Revenue)
For working professionals who wear sarees every day to the office.
The Idea: "The Professional’s Monthly Plan."
Example: ₹1999/month for 10 sarees (Ironing + Basic Fold + Pick-up).
Benefit: Guaranteed income every month instead of waiting for wedding seasons.

4. Interactive "Saree Stylist" Quiz
A fun way to engage visitors.
The Idea: A simple 3-step quiz: "What’s the event?" -> "What’s your body type?" -> "What’s the fabric?"
Result: Suggests the best pleating style (e.g., "You should go for the Flat-Pleat style with a floating pallu").
Benefit: Viral potential on social media.

5. Video Masterclasses (Digital Product)
If she becomes very famous for her draping style.
The Idea: A "Learn to Drape like a Pro" recorded video course.
Benefit: She can sell this to people outside her city (even internationally).

6. "Before & After" Interactive Slider
Once she has high-quality photos of the same saree "Before" (crushed) and "After" (professionally folded).
The Idea: A slider where the user drags a vertical bar to see the transformation.
Benefit: Highly satisfying and "visual proof" of her skill.

7. Google Reviews Integration
Once she has a "Google My Business" profile.
The Idea: Pull real-time 5-star reviews from Google onto the website automatically.
Benefit: Massive trust-building.

8. Multi-Language Support
Since sarees are a pan-India tradition.
The Idea: A toggle to view the site in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, or Hindi.
Benefit: Connects better with older generations who might be her primary customers for heavy silk care.
